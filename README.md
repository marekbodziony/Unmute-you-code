# Unmute-your-code

[Unmute your code](https://skillvalue.com/en/competitions/unmuteyourcode) - it was an online challange for programmers run by [SkillValue](https://skillvalue.com).  
Starts on **June 20** - Ends on **July 20**

</br></br>**The Unmute your code challenge:**
>Write an algorithm which analyzes 2 strings and checks if the characters from the first string can be rearranged to form the second string.
>If the first string can indeed be transformed in the second one, determine the minimum number of rearrangement operations required to turn the first string into the second.

>A rearrangement involves that only 2 characters in consecutive positions can be swapped.
The given strings is only represented by alphabetical characters, no need to check for capital letters, diacritics, accents, spaces, punctuation or word dividers.

>Input: 2 strings A and B.  
Output: P integer representing the minimum number of rearrangement required to turn the first string into the second.  
If the first string cannot be converted to the second string, the output will be -1.

>Examples:  
For here and hre => The output is -1.  
For here and here => The output is 0.  
For here and heer => The output is 1.

</br>**My score: 300/300**
